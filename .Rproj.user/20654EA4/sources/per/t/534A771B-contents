# R Markdown PDF Challenge

The following assignment is an exercise for the reproduction of this .html document using the RStudio and RMarkdown tools we’ve shown you in class. Hopefully by the end of this, you won’t feel at all the way this poor PhD student does. We’re here to help, and when it comes to R, the internet is a really valuable resource. This open-source program has all kinds of tutorials online.


![http://phdcomics.com/ Comic posted 1-17-2018](/Users/Leilynaz/documents/image.gif)


## Challenge Goals 

The goal of this R Markdown html challenge is to give you an opportunity to play with a bunch of different RMarkdown formatting. Consider it a chance to flex your RMarkdown muscles. Your goal is to write your own RMarkdown that rebuilds this html document as close to the original as possible. So, yes, this means you get to copy my irreverant tone exactly in your own Markdowns. It’s a little window into my psyche. Enjoy =)

**hint: go to the [PhD Comics website](http://phdcomics.com/) to see if you can find the image above**  
*If you can’t find that exact image, just find a comparable image from the PhD Comics website and include it in your markdown*

### Here's a header!

Let’s be honest, this header is a little arbitrary. But show me that you can reproduce headers with different levels please. This is a level 3 header, for your reference (you can most easily tell this from the table of contents).

#### Another header, now with maths

Perhaps you’re already really confused by the whole markdown thing. Maybe you’re so confused that you’ve forgotton how to add. Never fear! ~~A calculator~~ R is here:

```{r}
1231521+12341556280987
```


### Table Time 

Or maybe, after you’ve added those numbers, you feel like it’s about time for a table!  
I’m going to leave all the guts of the coding here so you can see how libraries (R packages) are loaded into R (more on that later). It’s not terribly pretty, but it hints at how R works and how you will use it in the future. The summary function used below is a nice data exploration function that you may use in the ^future^.

```{r}
library(knitr)
kable(summary(cars),caption="I made this table with kable in the knitr package library")
```


And now you’ve almost finished your first RMarkdown! Feeling excited? We are! In fact, we’re so excited that maybe we need a big finale eh? Here’s ours! Include a fun gif of your choice!

## Evidence Worksheet for "Prokaryotes: The Unseen Majority"


### Learning Objectives
Describe the numerical abundance of microbial life in relation to ecology and biogeochemistry of Earth systems.


### General Questions
#### What were the main questions being asked?

What is the number of prokaryotic cells in different environments on Earth? Which areas are the prokaryotes the most abundant? What is the amount of prokaryotic cellular carbon in different habitats? How much of the total Earth carbon content is contributed by the prokaryotic cellular carbon? What is the turn over rate of the prokaryotic population and how does it contribute to the mutation rate and therefore diversity in prokaryotes? 


#### What were the primary methodological approaches used?

The primary methodological approaches are estimations which is to take small samples to represent the habitat. Additionally, they use the cell density, volume, and cellular carbon of prokaryotes to calculate total number of cells in a habitat.
Specific calculation of each habitat methodological approaches: 
For aquatic environment (polar region)- they estimated number of prokaryotes based on the mean cell numbers reported in previous literature Delille and Rosiers, and the mean areal extent of seasonal ice. 
For soil- they estimated the number of prokaryotes based on detained direct counts from a coniferous forest ultisol. They used this estimate and applied it to all the forest soils.
For subsurface- they used few direct enumerationd of subsurface prokaryotes. For deeper sediments, they extrapolated the number of prokaryoted based on a formula. Another approach that they used is based on the porosity of the terrestrial subsurface, and total pore space occupied by prokaryotes. Also they used the number of unattached prokaryoted calculated from groundwater data from previous studies. 
To calculate Carbon content- They used the prokaryotic cell numbers, and then they assumed that the amount of the cellular carbon is half of the dry weight. They also assumed the amount of carbon production should be 4 times the the carbon content based on the efficiency of carbon assimilation. They used this information to make an assumption about the turn over rate of prokaryotes. 

#### Summarize the main results or findings. 

Most of the prokaryotes reside in open ocean (1.2 x 10^29), soil (1.2 x 10^29), oceanic (3.5 x 10^30) and terrestrial subsurfaces (0.25-2.5 x 10^30). The number of prokaryotes on Earth is estimated to be 4-6 x 10^30 cells. The amount of prokaryotic cellular carbon on Earth is estimated to be 350-550 Pg. Including prokaryotic carbon in global models will nearly double the amount of carbon stored in living organisms.Prokaryotes contain 85-130 Pg of N and 9-14 Pg of P, which is about 10-fold more nutrients than found in plants.The average turn over times of prokaryotes is 6-25 days in the upper 200 m of the open ocean, 0.8 yr in the ocean below 200 m, 2.5 yr in soil, and 1-2 x 10^3 yr in subsurface. The cellular production rate for prokaryotes is estimated to be 1.7 x 10^30 cells/year.Prokaryotes exist in plants, air, and leafs but the number is much lower compared to the large resivors. Due to the abundance of prokaryotes and high turn over rates, there is an enormous genetic diversity among prokaryotes.


#### Do new questions arise from the results?

How do we define prokaryotes? what is the composition of microbes in each compartment? What are the measures that have to be taken into account in the phylogenic analyses to distinguish prokaryotes from eukaroytes? Is there any better measuring techniques in place that can lower the assumptions and error? How reliable are the numbers that are mentioned in this article? How does the turn over rate of the prokaryotes affect the nutrient cycles and impact other organisms? 


#### Were there any specific challenges or advantages in understanding the paper (e.g. did the authors provide sufficient background information to understand experimental logic, were methods explained adequately, were any specific assumptions made, were conclusions justified based on the evidence, were the figures or tables useful and easy to understand)? 

The authors didn’t explain the calculations well and mostly provided us with the final numbers.It would be beneficial to have a supplementary attached which was going in to details of errors and how reliable are the numbers reported in the article.The authors didn't state their assumptions clearly. Additionally, the authors used a lot of data and methods from previous literatures but they didn't explain much about them

## Problem set_01 for "Prokaryotes: The Unseen Majority"


### Learning objective 
Describe the numerical abundance of microbial life in relation to the ecology and biogeochemistry of Earth systems. 

### Specific questions

#### What are the primary prokaryotic habitats on Earth and how do they vary with respect to their capacity to support life? Provide a breakdown of total cell abundance for each primary habitat from the tables provided in the text.

It has been indicated that most of the prokaryotes reside in three large habitats: seawater, soil and the sediment/soil subsurface. Aquatic- 1.181 x 10^29 cells. Soil- 2.556 x 10^29. Subsurface sediments- 3.8 x 10^30 (oceanic subsurface: 3.5 x 10^30 and terrestrial subsurface: 0.25-2.5 x 10^30).

#### What is the estimated prokaryotic cell abundance in the upper 200 m of the ocean and what fraction of this biomass is represented by marine cyanobacterium including Prochlorococcus? What is the significance of this ratio with respect to carbon cycling in the ocean and the atmospheric composition of the Earth?

The estimated prokaryotic cell abundance is 3.6 x 10^28 in the upper 200 m at cellular density of 5 x 10^5 cells/ml. The average cellular density of the autotrophic marine. cyanobacteria and *prochlorococcus spp.* in the upper 200 m is 4 x 10^4 cells/ml. The fraction is : (4x 10^4)/ (5x 10^5) = 8%. This means that 8% of the  autotrophic prokaryotes in charge of carbon cycle in the ocean to provide organic carbon for the majority of the hetrotrophic prokaryotes. 

#### What is the difference between an autotroph, heterotroph, and a lithotroph based on information provided in the text?

Autotrophs is "self- nourishing", fix inorganic carbon (CO2) into biomass using light source as energy. Heterotroph: assimilate organic carbon- Uses organic substrates for both Carbon and energy source. Litotroph: use inorganic substrates for C source and energy source.

#### Based on information provided in the text and your knowledge of geography what is the deepest habitat capable of supporting prokaryotic life? What is the primary limiting factor at this depth?

Subsurface: Teressterial and marine: ~4 Km deep in the subsurface there is life. Deepest point in the ocean is Mariana's Trench: 10.9 km down. Therefore 4 km lower than Mariana's Trech is 14.9 km deep down that life could exist.Temperature is the limiting factor- it is about 125 C. Change in temperature is 22 C/km. 

#### Based on information provided in the text your knowledge of geography what is the highest habitat capable of supporting prokaryotic life? What is the primary limiting factor at this height?

Mount Everst is the highest point which is about 8.8 km above the sea level. Also microbes have been found to be transported up to 77 km. However the limiting factor is the ionizing radiation and lack of nutrients and moisture. Therefore the microbes might not be metabolizing and maybe spores. 

#### Based on estimates of prokaryotic habitat limitation, what is the vertical distance of the Earth’s biosphere measured in km?

From the top of mount Everest (8.8 km up) to the bottom of Mariana's Trench (10.9 km down) and 4 km deeper in to the sediment is 24 km.

#### How was annual cellular production of prokaryotes described in Table 7 column four determined? (Provide an example of the calculation)

Population x turn overtime /year 
Ex. for marine habitats: (3.6 x 10^28 cells x 365 days/ 16 turnover = 8.2 x 10^29 cells/ yr)

#### What is the relationship between carbon content, carbon assimilation efficiency and turnover rates in the upper 200m of the ocean? Why does this vary with depth in the ocean and between terrestrial and marine habitats?

Carbon efficiency- assumed to be 20%- only this percent is being assimilated. 
About 5-20 fg on average C in prokaryotic cells (used 20 fg for calculations): About 20 x 10^-30 pg/ cell.

3.6 x 10^ 28 cells x 20 x10^-30 pg/ cell = 0.72 pg carbon in marine heterotrophs.

They used multiplier of 4 instead of 5 for 20%-> 4 x 0,72= 2.88 pg/ yr. 

51 pg/ yr (carbon in photic zone) x 85% consumed = 43 pg C 

43 pg C/ yr / 2.88 pg /yr = 14.9 or 1 turnover every 24.5 days. Half of the carbon of the planet is among the prokaryotes. This number vary with depth in ocean and between terrestrial and marine habitats due to the change in microbial population.

#### How were the frequency numbers for four simultaneous mutations in shared genes determined for marine heterotrophs and marine autotrophs given an average mutation rate of 4 x 10-7 per DNA replication? (Provide an example of the calculation with units. Hint: cell and generation cancel out)

For heterotrophes: 
(4 x 10^-7 mutations/ generations) ^4 = 2.56 x 10^-26 mutation/ generation 

365 days/ 16=22.8 turnover/ year

3.6 x 10^28 cells in marine x 22.8 turn over/year= 8.2 x 10^29 cells/ year. 

2.56 x 10^-26 mutation/generation x 8.2 x 10^29 cells/ year x 1 year/ 12 months x 1 month/ 28 days x 1 day/ 24 hours = 2.603 mutation/ hr 

Frequency: 1/ 2.603 = 0.4  

For autothrophes: (4 x 10^-7)^4 x 7.1 x 10^29 turn over/ year x 1 year/ 8064 hr= 2.553 mutation/ hr. 

Frequency: 1/ 2.553~ 0.5

#### Given the large population size and high mutation rate of prokaryotic cells, what are the implications with respect to genetic diversity and adaptive potential? Are point mutations the only way in which microbial genomes diversify and adapt?

Mutations in prokaryotic cells are the major source of diversity and one of the essential factors in the formation of novel species. Additionally, due to mutations, prokaryotes can be selected for and adapt to variety of environments. Point mutations are not the only way in which microbial genomes diversify and adapt. Horizontal gene transfer (HGT), insertions, deletions, and vertical gene transfer are other ways that microbial genome can diversity and adapt.

#### What relationships can be inferred between prokaryotic abundance, diversity, and metabolic potential based on the information provided in the text?

Large population size and rapid replication of prokaryotes implies that extremely rare events can occur frequently.  High mutation leads to increase in diversity and therefore increase in metabolic potential in response to stress and selective pressure.

## Problem set_02 “Microbial Engines”
### Learning objectives: 
Discuss the role of microbial diversity and formation of coupled metabolism in driving global biogeochemical cycles.

### Specific Questions:

#### What are the primary geophysical and biogeochemical processes that create and sustain conditions for life on Earth? How do abiotic versus biotic processes vary with respect to matter and energy transformation and how are they interconnected?  

Geophysical: Tectonics and atmospheric photochemical processes-> supply substrates and remove products. They allow elements and molecules to interact with each other, and chemical bonds to form and break in cyclical manner.

Biogeochemical:  The biological fluxes of 6 major elements- H,C,N,O,S, and P that constitute major building blocks for all biological macromolecules. Geochemical reactions are based on acid/ base chemistry. The biogeochemical fluxes are driven largely by microbes that catalyze thermodynamically constrained reactions. Additionally, volcanism and rock weathering play a role in resupply of C, S, and P. 

Abiotic reactions: are based on acid/base chemistry (transfer of protons without electrons).

Biotic reactions: redox reaction that is dependant on the successive transfers of electrons and protons from a relatively limited set of chemical elements.

The way that the biotic and abotic processes are interconnected is that biogeochemical cycles have evolved on a planetary scale to form a set of nested abiotiotically driven acid/base reactions and biologically driven redox reactions that set lower limits on external energy that are required to sustain these cycles.

#### Why is Earth’s redox state considered an emergent property?

This is because feedbacks between the evolution of microbial metabolic and geochemical processes create the average redox condition of the oceans and atmosphere. Therefore, Earth's redox state is an emergent property of microbial life on a planetary scale. 

#### How do reversible electron transfer reactions give rise to element and nutrient cycles at different ecological scales? What strategies do microbes use to overcome thermodynamic barriers to reversible electron flow?  

Microbes carry genes that encode the multimerci protein complexes (machinery) responsible for redox chemistry (transfers of electron and protons) half-cells that form the basis of the major energy transducting pathways. In order to overcome thermodynamic barriers to reversible electron flow, microbes use identical or near-identical pathways for forward and reverse reactions to maintain cycles. That in one direction the process is oxidative, dissimilatory and energy producing, and in the other direction it is reductive, assimilatory and energy consuming. This process requires the synergistic cooperation of multispecies assemblages, a phenomenon that is typical for most biogeochemical transformations.

#### Using information provided in the text, describe how the nitrogen cycle partitions between different redox “niches” and microbial groups. Is there a relationship between the nitrogen cycle and climate change?   

For N2 to become accessible and be used in the synthesis of nucleic acids and proteins, N2 should be changed to NH4+ via nitrogen fixation. However, the enzyme responsible for fixation is inhibited by Oxygen. In the presence of oxygen, NH4+ can be oxidized to nitrate in a two-stage pathway, initially requiring a specific group of Bacteria or archea that oxidize ammonia to NO2- (via hydroxyamine), which is subsequently oxidized to NO3- by a different suite of nitrifying bacteria. The small differences in redox potential in the redox reactions is used by nitrifiers to reduce CO2 to organic matter. Finally, in the absence of oxygen, a third set of opportunistic microbes uses NO2- and NO3- as electron acceptors in anaerobic oxidation of organic matter. This pathway will ultimately form N2.  

The major cuase of climate change is the green house effect due to increase in the concentration of green house gasses in the Earth's atmosphere such as CO2. The nitrogen cycle affects the climate change, as CO2 is reduced to organic matter by the oxidation of NH4+ to NO2 and NO2 to NO3. Therefore this reduces atmospherinc CO2. 

#### What is the relationship between microbial diversity and metabolic diversity and how does this relate to the discovery of new protein families from microbial community genomes?  

The more diverse that the microbial community is, the more diverse are the metabolic activities that are observed in the community. The number of new protein families found are increasing linearly with the number of new genome sequenced. Also the discovery rate for new proteins is linearly even when the known number of protein sequences is increased threefold. This indicates that the journey of cataloguing extant protein sequence space is relatively new due to the limitless evolutionary diversity in nature. 


#### On what basis do the authors consider microbes the guardians of metabolism?  

Environmental selection on the microbial phenotype leads to the evolution of the boutique genes that ultimately protect the metabolic pathway. Dispersal of the core planetary gene set whether by vertical or horizontal gene transfer, has allowed wide variety of organisms to become guardians of metabolism simultaneously. That is even the pathway in a specific operational taxonomic unit does not survive an environmental perturbation the unit will go extinct but the pathway has a strong chance of survival in other units.

## Problem set_03 “Metagenomics: Genomic Analysis of Microbial Communities”

#### Learning objectives: 
Specific emphasis should be placed on the process used to find the answer. Be as comprehensive as possible e.g. provide URLs for web sources, literature citations, etc.  

#### Specific Questions:

####How many prokaryotic divisions have been described and how many have no cultured representatives (microbial dark matter)?

In 2016, 89 bacterial phyla and 20 archeal phyla have been decribed via 16s rRNA databases. However, there could be uo to 15000 bacterial phyla, since most of the microbes are living life in "shadow bioshphere".

In 2003, 26 of the 52 major bacterial phyla have been cultivated (probably more now). 

#### How many metagenome sequencing projects are currently available in the public domain and what types of environments are they sourced from?

There are currently around 110,217 metagenome sequencing projects on EB database which is just a small fraction of projects. They sourced from different types of the environments such as soil, aquatics, sediments.   

#### What types of on-line resources are available for warehousing and/or analyzing environmental sequence information (provide names, URLS and applications)?  

Shot gun metagenomics: 

Assembly- EULERT 
Binning- S-Gcom 
Annotation- KEGG 
Analysis pipelines- Megan 5 

Marker Gene Metagenomics: 

Standalone- OTUbase 
Analysis pipelines- SILVA 
Denoising- Amplicon Noise 
Databases- Ribosomal Database Project (RDP)

#### What is the difference between phylogenetic and functional gene anchors and how can they be used in metagenome analysis?   

Phylogenetic: vertical gene transfer, carry phyogenic information, allowing tree creconstruction, taxonomic and ideally single copy. 

Functional: more horizontal gene, identify specific biogeochemical functions associated with measurable effects, not as useful as phylogeny.

#### What is metagenomic sequence binning? What types of algorithmic approaches are used to produce sequence bins? What are some risks and opportunities associated with using sequence bins for metabolic reconstruction of uncultivated microorganisms?  

Metagenomic sequence bining is the process of grouping sequences that come from a single genome. The algorithmic approaches that are used are aligning along data bases or based on specific characteristics such as G/C content.The risks that are possible is the incomplete coverafe and contamination from different phylogeny. 

#### Is there an alternative to metagenomic shotgun sequencing that can be used to access the metabolic potential of uncultivated microorganisms? What are some risks and opportunities associated with this alternative?  

Functional screens (biochemical etc.), Gene sequencing (Nanopore), single cell sequencing, FISH probe.

## Problem set_04 “Fine-scale phylogenetic architecture”
#### Learning objectives: 

Gain experience estimating diversity within a hypothetical microbial community

#### Outline:

In class Day 1:

1. Define and describe species within your group's "microbial" community.
2. Count and record individuals within your defined species groups.
3. Remix all species together to reform the original community.
4. Each person in your group takes a random sample of the community (*i.e.* devide up the candy).

Assignment:

5. Individually, complete a collection curve for your sample.
6. Calculate alpha-diversity based on your original total community and your individual sample.

In class Day 2:

7. Compare diversity between groups.

#### Part 1: Description and enumeration
Obtain a collection of "microbial" cells from "seawater". The cells were concentrated from different depth intervals by a marine microbiologist travelling along the Line-P transect in the northeast subarctic Pacific Ocean off the coast of Vancouver Island British Columbia. 

Sort out and identify different microbial "species" based on shared properties or traits. Record your data in this Rmarkdown using the example data as a guide.

Once you have defined your binning criteria, separate the cells using the sampling bags provided. These operational taxonomic units (OTUs) will be considered separate "species". This problem set is based on content available at [What is Biodiversity](http://cnx.org/content/m12179/latest/).

```{r}
library(kableExtra)
library(knitr)
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
```

For your community:

Construct a table listing each species, its distinguishing characteristics, the name you have given it, and the number of occurrences of the species in the collection.
Ask yourself if your collection of microbial cells from seawater represents the actual diversity of microorganisms inhabiting waters along the Line-P transect. Were the majority of different species sampled or were many missed?
